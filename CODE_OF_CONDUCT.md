# 😊 Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, curious, diverse, inclusive, constructive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

We strive to create an environment where we can all grow together. We ask that everyone try to act in the following ways:

**Be respectful**

- Listen actively and engage thoughtfully
- Treat others with courtesy and consideration
- Recognize that we're all learning and making mistakes

**Stay curious and humble**

- Approach disagreements with genuine curiosity
- Acknowledge when you don't know something
- Remember that we're all spinning on this space dust together, figuring things out as we go

**Contribute constructively**

- Share knowledge generously
- Give helpful feedback by imagining how others might be affected
- Focus on the work and ideas, not personal attacks

**Don't take things personally**

- Recognize that someone's behavior towards you may have nothing to do with you
- Acknowledge that others may have learned how to treat themselves and others differently than you
- Remember that it takes all kinds and everyone has bad days

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will try to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

## Enforcement

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community.

To report any instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior, you can [contact me directly][email]. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and with the intent of unbiased judgement. All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy of the reporter of any incident.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.
